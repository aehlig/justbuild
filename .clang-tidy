# Here is an explanation for why some of the checks are disabled:

# bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters: This check would require significant 
# refactoring effort.

# bugprone-unchecked-optional-access: Too many false positives. For example, 
# an explicit comparison with std::nullopt isn't considered a check.

# cppcoreguidelines-avoid-const-or-ref-data-members: We believe, ref data 
# members are a good way to express ownership, and const data members improve
# readability.

# cppcoreguidelines-rvalue-reference-param-not-moved: Too many false positives,
# especially with partial moves from STL containers.

# misc-const-correctness: Too many false positives, especially with STL 
# containers.

# misc-include-cleaner: There is no way for symbol mapping. For example, this
# check requires to delete the "gsl/gsl" header, but at the same time asks to
# include one for gsl::not_null.

# misc-use-anonymous-namespace: This check would require significant refactoring
# effort, but wouldn't improve readability equally.

# misc-no-recursion: There are legitimate uses for us: we use recursion for
# trees a lot.

# modernize-return-braced-init-list: We think removing typenames and using only
# braced-init can hurt readability.

# performance-avoid-endl: There are too many legitimate uses of std::endl for
# us.

# readability-identifier-length: We would like to enable this check, but it
# would require significant refactoring effort.
